# The task

Develop a simple Personal Task Manager application using React, focusing on foundational concepts such as state management, component composition, and basic event handling. This application will allow users to add, display, and delete tasks.

## Requirements

1. Task input form:

- Use a functional component with the useState hook to create a form where users can enter a task and add it to their list.
- Include an input field for the task description and a submit button.

2. Task display list:

- Display the list of tasks dynamically. Each task should be a separate component that displays the task description.
- Implement a simple state management solution using the useState hook to store the list of tasks.

3. Delete task feature:

- Next to each task in the list, include a delete button.
- Clicking the delete button should remove the task from the list.

4. No tasks placeholder:

- Display a message when there are no tasks in the list, encouraging the user to add a new task.

## Bonus challenge (optional)

- Task completion feature: Add a feature that allows users to mark tasks as completed. You could represent this visually by striking through the task description or changing its colour.
- Local storage: Implement local storage to save the task list, ensuring tasks persist even when the browser refreshes.
- Task editing: Allow users to edit the description of tasks after they have been added.

This task reinforces your understanding of key React concepts by developing a practical, real-world application. It’s an opportunity to practice state management, component structure, and basic React patterns. Enjoy building your Personal Task Manager!

Given the task requirements for creating a simple Personal Task Manager application in React, here’s a basic solution outline that covers the main functionalities, including adding, displaying, and deleting tasks and incorporating optional features like task completion and persistence with local storage.
